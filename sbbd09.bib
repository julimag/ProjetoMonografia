  title = {{XML Path Language (XPath) 2.0}},
  howpublished = {W3C - World Wide Web Consortium},
  month = {January},
  year = {2007},
  abstract = {XPath 2.0 is an expression language that allows the processing of
	values conforming to the data model defined in the XQuery 1.0 and
	XPath 2.0 Data Model (XDM). The data model provides a tree representation
	of XML documents as well as atomic values such as integers, strings,
	and booleans, and sequences that may contain both references to nodes
	in an XML document and atomic values. The result of an XPath expression
	may be a selection of nodes from the input documents, or an atomic
	value, or more generally, any sequence allowed by the data model.
	The name of the language derives from its most distinctive feature,
	the path expression, which provides a means of hierarchic addressing
	of the nodes in an XML tree. XPath 2.0 is a superset of XPath 1.0,
	with the added capability to support a richer set of data types,
	and to take advantage of the type information that becomes available
	when documents are validated using XML Schema. A backwards compatibility
	mode is provided to ensure that nearly all XPath 1.0 expressions
	continue to deliver the same result with XPath 2.0; exceptions to
	this policy are noted in Section I (Backwards Compatibility with
	XPath 1.0).},
